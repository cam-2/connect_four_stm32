# Connect_Four_STM32

The connect_Four_STM32 program built was developed and tested for the STM32F429i microcontroller. It features a single player mode, where the user plays the game as "Yellow" against an AI built on a mini-max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, as well as a two-player mode intended for two users to play. It has full touch compatibility with the LCD display, where the user can control which column they would like to place the coin by pressing on the display. The coin will move one column corresponding to where on x-axis the user touched. When a user would like to drop their coin, they can press the button on the left-hand side of the microcontroller, oriented with the display of the game. The game rules follow that of traditional Connect Four - either player will win if four of their respective pieces are aligned horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A game concludes when either play wins, or if there are no more holes to place a coin. After the game concludes, a screen displays the number of wins of each respective during the current game session, as well as giving the user the option to play again, following the game mode of the original choice.
